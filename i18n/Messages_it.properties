Observe the lovingly animated interaction of the animals - with other animals, the landscape, the play equipment, or the visitors to the park\! Just like in a real zoo, the animals must receive all-round care. This is as easy as winking in Wildlife Park 2\: With a click of the mouse you can feed, doctor, pet, or even relocate animals, or get them moving. You will guide a team of landscape architects, gardeners, keepers, veterinarians, and scientists. If you manage your zoo carefully, you will soon be able to celebrate the birth of new animals\! Construct your zoo using more than 100 animal houses, visitor facilities, staff buildings, decorative park elements, and enclosure equipment. Wildlife Park 2 is an ideal playground for amateur architects, too\! Use the extensive terraforming options to create your own imaginative landscapes. Plenty of established plant species and botanical rarities such us underwater plants or cacti will thrive under your loving care, and all this is lavishly displayed by a dynamic plant system. Another specialty is the realistically simulated flow of water. By easily placing a water source, you can create thunderous waterfalls and rambling water worlds. Visitors to your zoo will expect a few treats, too - build restaurants and ice-cream parlors and provide spectacular entertainment. Employ advertising and marketing to attract new visitors. But don't forget to keep an eye on your zoo's budget at all times\!

Your crew are fighting and new life forms begin to appear in the canteen. You are somewhere in the Universe with a limited amount of resources, a corporation that sent you into space awaits back at the Earth, and your colonists expect payment. Everyone has their own mind, so remember the golden rule\: a happy crew is a productive crew. You must build a base and defend it against aliens, but do not forget about your crew. If you treat them well, they will work hard for you. In Space Colony your career and life depend on an unruly team that wants to return to Earth. When creating a colony, you have over 100 different structures to choose from, which will help you build a great base for your crew. So before you spend all your savings on iron mining and the production of space chickens, keep in mind that without laser towers, saunas and restaurants no one will want to work for you\!

Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.<br/>Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.<br/>Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn\u2019t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

After an emergency landing on a foreign water planet you can only look in the depths. Discover seaweed forests and grass plateaus, reefs and labyrinths of underwater caves, but remember the ever-diminished oxygen. Water is swarming with life\: some creatures are useful, but a large part is dangerous. When you wake up in a life capsule, you fight with time - you need to find drinking water, food, and develop equipment that will be useful during exploration. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Create knives, lighting, diving equipment, and build small submarines. The ocean is full of life\: use the ecosystem to your advantage. Lure and outwit the dangerous creature with a fresh fish, or just swim as fast as you can to avoid the jaws of omnipresent predators. Cave systems extend below the bottom of the ocean - from dark, claustrophobic passages to caves illuminated by bioluminescent life forms. Explore the world below the bottom of the ocean, but watch out for oxygen levels and avoid the dangers lurking in the dark.
