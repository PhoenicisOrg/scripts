	"description": "Subnautica is a game about exploration and adventure set in an underwater world. After an emergency landing on a foreign water planet you can only look in the depths. Discover seaweed forests and grass plateaus, reefs and labyrinths of underwater caves, but remember the ever-diminished oxygen. Water is swarming with life: some creatures are useful, but a large part is dangerous. When you wake up in a life capsule, you fight with time - you need to find drinking water, food, and develop equipment that will be useful during exploration. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Create knives, lighting, diving equipment, and build small submarines. The ocean is full of life: use the ecosystem to your advantage. Lure and outwit the dangerous creature with a fresh fish, or just swim as fast as you can to avoid the jaws of omnipresent predators. Cave systems extend below the bottom of the ocean - from dark, claustrophobic passages to caves illuminated by bioluminescent life forms. Explore the world below the bottom of the ocean, but watch out for oxygen levels and avoid the dangers lurking in the dark."
